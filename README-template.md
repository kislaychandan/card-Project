## My process

### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
-


### What I learned

I have learn what not to do if using flex. How to bring the stuff in center
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```



### Continued development
I have to focus on eveything. It look me 2 tries and 2 days to get this design. It is still non responsive and I have lot of issues and question.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-remove-white-space-under-an-image-using-css.php) - This helped me to remove space below the image. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
